\section{Project Description}

\subsection{Overview}
This project implements a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot system using the Mistral 7B language model optimized with Unsloth framework. The system enables users to upload PDF documents and ask questions, receiving contextually relevant answers based on the document content.

\subsection{Technical Architecture}
The system employs a modular architecture consisting of several key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Language Model}: Unsloth-optimized Mistral 7B with 4-bit quantization for efficient local inference
    \item \textbf{Document Processing}: PyPDFLoader for PDF text extraction and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for intelligent text chunking
    \item \textbf{Vector Database}: ChromaDB implementation for semantic search and retrieval
    \item \textbf{Embeddings}: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for text vectorization
    \item \textbf{User Interface}: Gradio-based web interface for intuitive interaction
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Local Processing}: Complete offline operation without internet dependency
    \item \textbf{Memory Efficiency}: Optimized to run on systems with 8GB RAM using 4-bit quantization
    \item \textbf{PDF Support}: Direct processing of PDF documents with automatic text extraction
    \item \textbf{Semantic Search}: Advanced vector-based retrieval for contextually relevant responses
    \item \textbf{Modern UI}: User-friendly web interface for seamless document interaction
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Specifications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model}: Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 (4-bit quantized)
    \item \textbf{Sequence Length}: 2048 tokens maximum
    \item \textbf{Generation Parameters}: Temperature 0.5, Top-k 50, Top-p 0.95
    \item \textbf{Text Chunking}: 1000 characters per chunk with 50 character overlap
    \item \textbf{Memory Usage}: Approximately 8GB RAM
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
The system follows a standard RAG pipeline:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item PDF document upload and text extraction
    \item Text segmentation into manageable chunks
    \item Vector embedding generation using sentence transformers
    \item Storage in ChromaDB vector database
    \item Query processing with semantic similarity search
    \item Context-aware response generation using the language model
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Response Time}: Varies based on document size and query complexity
    \item \textbf{Accuracy}: High contextual relevance through semantic search
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Suitable for documents up to several hundred pages
    \item \textbf{Resource Efficiency}: Optimized for consumer-grade hardware
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications}
This system is particularly useful for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Academic research and document analysis
    \item Business document processing and Q\&A
    \item Legal document review and information extraction
    \item Educational content exploration and learning support
    \item Technical documentation search and comprehension
\end{itemize}
